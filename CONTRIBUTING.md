# How to get involved
Pontoon Tools started as my personal project, but it's dedicated to the community of Mozilla localizers and I am open to any inputs or contributions.

## Use Pontoon Tools
For Mozilla localizers the easiest way to get involved is to use Pontoon Tools, [report bugs, request features](https://github.com/MikkCZ/pontoon-tools/issues) or send some short feedback to the [dev-l10n list](https://lists.mozilla.org/listinfo/dev-l10n).

## Code
For those, who prefer coding, you can find a technical overview of how Pontoon Tools work inside on [this wiki page](https://github.com/MikkCZ/pontoon-tools/wiki/Technical-Overview). After reading it, feel free to [pick a task](https://github.com/MikkCZ/pontoon-tools/issues) and leave a comment you would like to work on it. In the meantime, before I get back to you, here are few tips to help you start.

Before you start making any changes, make sure you can build the add-on on your machine. You will find the required [tools and hints here](https://github.com/MikkCZ/pontoon-tools/wiki/Technical-Overview#tools). If you are in doubt what to do, do not hesitate to write a comment in the task you are working and ask for help.

#### Submitting a patch
When creating and pushing your commits, please write a meaningful commit message, what has been changed. Please also run `npm test` again to ensure your code is well formatted and without obvious errors. When nothing is red, create a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/).
